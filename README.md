## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification
- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Decision_Tree)
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Random_Forest)
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Support_Vector_Machine)
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/K-Nearest_Neighbour)
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Logistic_Regression)
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Naive_Bayes)
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Gradient_Boosting)

### 2. Regression
- **Linear Regression** – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Linear_Regression)
- **Ridge Regression** – [Ridge Regression Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Ridge_Regression)
- **Lasso Regression** – [Lasso Regression Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Lasso_Regression)
- **Elastic Net Regression** - [Elastic Net Regression Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Elastic_Net_Regression)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering
- **K - Means Clustering** - [K - Means Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/K-Means_Clustering)
- **Hierarchial Clustering** - [Hierarchial Clustering Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Hierarchical_Clustering)
- **DBSCAN** - [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/DBSCAN)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA (Principle Component Analysis)** - [PCA Repo](https://github.com/johnjabez15/Principle_Component_Analysis)
