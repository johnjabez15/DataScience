Data Scientist – Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning algorithms organized by Supervised and Unsupervised Learning methods, along with links to respective GitHub repositories for each algorithm.

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

1. Classification
Decision Trees – Decision Tree Repo
Random Forest – Random Forest Repo
SVM (Support Vector Machines) – SVM Repo
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) – KNN Repo
Logistic Regression – Logistic Regression Repo
Naive Bayes – Naive Bayes Repo
Gradient Boosting – Gradient Boosting Repo
2. Regression
Linear Regression – Linear Regression Repo
Ridge Regression – Ridge Regression Repo
Lasso Regression – Lasso Regression Repo
Elastic Net Regression – Elastic Net Repo
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

1. Clustering
K-Means – K-Means Repo
Hierarchical Clustering – Hierarchical Clustering Repo
DBSCAN – DBSCAN Repo
2. Dimensionality Reduction
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – PCA Repo
